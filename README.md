### Four Generations of the Walker Family

This visualization shows four generations of my Irish extended family. It all began when Eileen Murtha married Joseph Walker in 1947. Our family has grown a lot but has remained close. As of 2015, Eileen (90 years old) and Joseph (deceased)  have 7 children, 7 in-laws, 24 grandchildren, 14 grand-in-laws and 26 great-grandchildren. That's 78 people to consider when planning parties, vacations, weddings, and funerals.

### Purpose of the Tree

**For Family:** Keeping track can be exhuasting (especially at the rate that my family expands). This tree makes it easy to track details as the family grows.

**For Friends:**  Explaining the interconnectivity of my family to other people can be difficult. I can now use this updated family tree to show friends why being a part of my family feels like a full-time job. 

###What The Visual Shows

* High fertility
* Low chance of twins
* Very few single people in my generation
* If this rate of reproduction continues (on average each grandchild has 3 kids) Eileen Walker could live to meet 
* 70 of her great grandchildren
* Predominantly white, very few family members of color

### Interactivity
