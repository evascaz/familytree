### Four Generations of the Walker Family

This visualization shows four generations of my Irish extended family. It all began when Eileen Murtha married Joseph Walker in 1947. Our family has grown a lot but has remained close. As of 2015, Eileen (90 years old) and Joseph (deceased)  have 7 children, 7 in-laws, 24 grandchildren, 14 grand-in-laws and 26 great-grandchildren. That's 78 people to consider when planning parties, vacations, weddings, and funerals.

### Purpose of the Tree

**For Family:** Keeping track can be exhuasting (especially at the rate that my family expands). This tree makes it easy to track details as the family grows.

**For Friends:**  Explaining the interconnectivity of my family to other people can be difficult. I can now use this updated family tree to show friends why being a part of my family feels like a full-time job. 

###What The Visual Shows

* Circle shapes show blood realtives, hex shapes show in-laws by marriage 
* High fertility
* Low chance of twins
* Few single people
* If this rate of reproduction continues (on average each grandchild has 3 kids) Eileen Walker could live to meet 
70 of her great grandchildren
* Predominantly white, very few family members of color

### Interactivity 

* Profile pictures appear when mouse hovers
* Zoom into different areas of tree
* Collapsible 3rd generation 
* Click on a person and an info bar appears (will include bday, gender, location)
